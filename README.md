# HPC4M Global Minima of Benchmark Optimisation Problems

Aim: Implement algorithms to find the global minima of the Eggholder function and Shekel function exploiting parallel architectures in an orderly C++ way.

## Structure
[ ]  Use of Eigen or Armadillo?
[ ] Intel MKL for distributed linear algebra  


## Basic Algorithms
Algorithms:
[ ] Gradient Descent
[ ] Stochastic Gradient Descent
[ ] BFGS 
[ ] Nelder Mead
Opportunities to parallelise?
Crossover with sampling algorithms?

## Algorithms Designed for Parallel
[ ] Particle Swarm 
[ ] Work of Lelievre? -- parallel replica algorithm (possibly for metastable particle systems rather than optimisation)
